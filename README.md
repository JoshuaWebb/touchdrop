# Touch Drop

Play the game at https://joshuawebb.github.io/touchdrop

(For the best play experience, I suggest using an Android touch device
running a recent version of Chrome.)

This project was made predominantly to explore/practice react
development so I don't expect it to win any awards for unique /
ground-breaking game design. With that said, this is my attempt at
making a (falling^) block puzzle game with a more mobile friendly
control scheme; I've never really been a fan of "virtual/software"
buttons that mimic traditional hardware buttons.

^At present, the blocks don't actually fall, and at this point I'm
still not sure if they ever will.
